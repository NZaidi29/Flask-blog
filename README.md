# Flask-blog
This was a blog created for the purposes of an assignment, initially it contained a secret key and credentials for a database that I created for the project but they are currently removed.
The blog contains only features required by the assignment such as a search bar, ability to comment on posts, like posts and save them. It also includes user account registration and log in as well as personalised greetings on log in.
